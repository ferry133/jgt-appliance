# Encrypt rendered SOPS files, keeping the committed ciphertext when the
# plaintext has not changed.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# `task configure` re-renders every template on every run (makejinja `force =
# true`), which overwrites each *.sops.* file with fresh plaintext. The old
# encrypt step then saw `encrypted: false` -- correctly -- and re-encrypted.
#
# SOPS derives a new data key and new IVs on every encryption, so identical
# plaintext produces entirely different ciphertext. Measured, not assumed:
# encrypting two byte-identical files with the same recipient yields different
# `ENC[AES256_GCM,data:...,iv:...]` for every value.
#
# The result was ~162 lines of secret diff on every no-op `task configure`.
# That is not cosmetic. Deciding such a diff is safe means decrypting both
# sides and comparing plaintext, and nobody does that on the twentieth run --
# so the diff stops being read, and the run where it *is* a real secret change
# looks exactly like the nineteen before it. A signal that fires every time is
# a signal that has been muted.
#
# So: encrypt only what actually changed. If HEAD already holds ciphertext that
# decrypts to exactly what we just rendered, put HEAD's bytes back.
#
# Fail-safe direction: every uncertainty (not tracked, not in HEAD, HEAD not
# encrypted, decryption fails, bytes differ) falls through to a normal
# encryption. The committed copy is only restored on a proven byte-identical
# match, so this can lose churn and cannot lose a change.
